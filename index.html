      planet Tanim, a sentient world with four large organs that
      govern its biosphere: Water, Earth, Air and Fire. They plan to
      relocate to Tanim, believing that a sentient planet will be an
      unlimited source for food for them."

                From 1998 to 2004, I wrote and drew a long-form comic graphic
                novel called "Tanim: Am Ende der Welt" stretching across more
                than 200 pages.
              </p>

                The story is set in an alternate Vienna in the 1990s. The
                population is full of alien beings. The main character is
                Jochen, a night watch man in a storage facility in a part of the
                city called Spittelau. Since he works in the night, some
                vampires in a neighboring building believe that he is one of
                them and they confide in him about their great plan. The
                vampires send a drone spaceship to a nearby planet. It is the
                planet Tanim, a sentient world with four large organs that
                govern its biosphere: Water, Earth, Air and Fire. They plan to
                relocate to Tanim, believing that a sentient planet will be an
                unlimited source for food for them.

                While I was exporting the individual pages for this website, I
                came to realize that the story is actually not too bad. There
                are many rough parts but overall the story holds together
                surprisingly well.
              </p>

                Despite having started work on this before I published XEGO, I
                incorporated a number of characters from the later work. Dani-E,
                the intergalactic go-go dancer had transformed into the godess
                of evolution at the end of the original run of XEGO. She is the
                narrator of Tanim. I also added a battle between Captain Austria
                and Travellic. The main character, Jochen gets unwillingly
                involved in two entirely unrelated plots. In the first, the
                vampire's make preparations to go to Tanim. In the second,
                Jochen's old friend Tuttl suggests secretly sneaking into each
                other's bedrooms to spend the night with the other's wife. Both
                these plots go awry.
              </p>

              <p>
                The story marches towards what is ostensibly the end of the
                world ("Das Ende der Welt"). It culminates in an all-out
                slugfest and the sentient planet coming to Earth.

                The comic is split into three parts. In this gallery, you can
                again see the pages without the original German captions and
                dialog. I will revisit the plot and describe it here on this
                website at a later point.
